//! # Handling Files Relative to File Descriptor
//!
//! Main concept here is a `Dir` which holds `O_PATH` file descriptor, you
//! can create it with:
//!
//! * `Dir::open("/some/path")` -- open this directory as a file descriptor
//! * `Dir::cwd()` -- current working directory
//!
//! *Note after opening file descriptors refer to same directory regardless of
//! where it's moved or mounted (with `pivot_root` or `mount --move`). It may
//! also be unmounted or be out of chroot and you will still be able to
//! access files relative to it.*
//!
//! *Note that `Dir::cwd()` always refers to the current working directory of
//! an application (and doesn't keep file descriptor too) and is sensitive
//! to `chdir`. But otherwise behaves the same (i.e. directory may be
//! moved and process is still in it). Anyway it's not more useful than
//! just using relative paths and traditional filesystem utilities.*
//!
//! Most other operations are done on `Dir` object and are executed relative
//! to it:
//!
//! * `Dir::list_dir()`
//! * `Dir::sub_dir()`
//! * `Dir::read_link()`
//! * `Dir::open_file()`
//! * `Dir::create_file()`
//! * `Dir::create_dir()`
//! * `Dir::symlink()`
//! * `Dir::local_rename()`
//!
//! Functions that expect path relative to the directory accept both the
//! traditional path-like objects, such as Path, PathBuf and &str, and
//! `Entry` type returned from `list_dir()`. The latter is faster as underlying
//! system call wants `CString` and we keep that in entry.
//!
//! Note that if path supplied to any method of dir is absolute the Dir file
//! descriptor is ignored.
//!
//! Also while all methods of dir accept any path if you want to prevent
//! certain symlink attacks and race condition you should only use
//! a single-component path. I.e. open one part of a chain at a time.
//!
